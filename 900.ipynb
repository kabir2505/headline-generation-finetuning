Fine-tuning such a model on Colab without memory optimizations can lead to long training times or out-of-memory errors.'\n",

        "\n",
        "- **`lora_dropout = 0.1`**:\n",

        "- **`target_modules = ['q_proj', 'k_proj']`**:\n",
        "  - **Reasoning**: LoRA is applied only to the query (`q_proj`) and key (`k_proj`) layers. The value projection (`v_proj`) layer was omitted to avoid increasing the number of parameters, which could counteract the purpose of LoRA. This choice helps reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance.\n",

        "### Reasons Why BART-CNN May Perform Better Than T5-Base\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Larger Number of Parameters**:\n",
        "   - **T5-Base** has 220 million parameters, whereas **BART-CNN** has 406 million. The larger number of parameters in BART-CNN allows it to capture more intricate relationships in data and provides greater expressiveness, making it more capable of handling complex text generation tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Specialized Pretraining on Summarization Tasks**:\n",
        "   - BART-CNN is specifically pretrained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for summarization, which aligns more closely with headline generation tasks. This specialized pretraining gives BART-CNN an edge when tasked with generating concise summaries or headlines, whereas T5 is a more general-purpose model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Denoising Autoencoder Approach**:\n",
        "   - BART uses a denoising autoencoder approach, where parts of the input are corrupted and the model is trained to predict the missing parts. This makes BART especially strong in generative tasks like headline generation, as it has learned to deal with incomplete or noisy inputs, similar to how headlines need to summarize and capture key details from longer articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Higher Capacity for Learning Complex Representations**:\n",
        "   - With BART-CNN’s larger capacity (406M params vs. 220M in T5-Base), it is able to learn more complex representations of the input text. This helps it produce more nuanced and accurate outputs, particularly for tasks requiring high-level abstraction, such as summarizing news articles into concise headlines.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Superior Performance on Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**:\n",
        "   - BART-CNN has shown superior performance on text generation tasks, especially in summarization, due to its denoising pretraining and large parameter size. These advantages translate well into tasks like headline generation where the model needs to condense large amounts of information into a succinct form.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Greater Fine-tuning Potential**:\n",
        "   - With more parameters and a more specialized architecture, BART-CNN can benefit more from fine-tuning on specific datasets. This means that with proper fine-tuning, BART-CNN can outperform T5-Base in headline generation and similar tasks where summarization and condensation of information are crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "Given the larger number of parameters, specialized pretraining on summarization tasks, and a more suitable architecture for text generation, BART-CNN is expected to outperform T5-Base in headline generation tasks. The model's ability to generate more precise and coherent summaries makes it a better candidate for tasks like this."
